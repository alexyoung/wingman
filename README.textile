This is an open source to-do list web application.  It features a rich desktop-like interface.

"Try the demo":http://wingman.heroku.com/

h3. Installation

You'll need the following:

# An account with an OpenID provider.  These are easier to come by than you might think (if you use Flickr you have one through Yahoo!)
# A mongo server.  I use "MongoHQ":http://mongohq.com/ for some projects, but it's easy to install locally (with apt, homebrew, ports, etc.)
# A web server for public use.  Apache or Nginx with "Passenger":http://www.modrails.com/ will work great
# This project will also work well with Heroku

To install:

# Check the project out with <code>git clone</code>
# Fill out your Mongo server details in <code>config/mongoid.yml</code>
# Run <code>bundle install</code> (prefix with <code>sudo<code> if required)
# Run <code>rails server</code> or install for your web server

h3. Heroku Configuration

Run this to add the settings Mongo requires:

<code>
heroku config:add MONGOID_HOST=server_hostname MONGOID_PORT=27039 MONGOID_DATABASE=database_name MONGOID_USERNAME=username MONGOID_PASSWORD=password
</code>
